CPU Scheduling Simulator
Technologies used: HTML | CSS | JavaScript

CPU Scheduling Simulator is a dynamic and visually appealing web application to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms. Built with an intuitive UI and real-time Gantt chart rendering, the project enables users to gain a better understanding of how scheduling algorithms operate through hands-on interaction.

Features:
i) Both Preemptive and Non-Preemptive scheduling algorithms are supported.
ii) Comprises key algorithms: FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive), and Round Robin.
iii) Calculates real-time Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Average Times.
iv) Student-oriented, teacher-recommended.

Purpose:
Developed to help users visualize how CPU scheduling algorithms function internally. Perfect for classroom demonstrations, lab tutorials, and self-learning.
